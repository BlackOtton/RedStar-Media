# RedStar-Media
Extracted media files from North Korean OS, Red Star 3.0

# What can I find here?
You will find here a collection of various wallpapers, themes, icons and sounds from North Korean operating system called Red Star OS 3.0.

# Can I use themes from here on my actual Linux Distro?
From initial testing with Ubuntu 18.04 and Kubuntu 20.04, it seems like it is possible. You might run into some compatibility issues with GTK2 themes.
If someone wants to, feel free to try making this into a real thing.

# Sounds folder is nowhere to be found.
Red Star uses uses standard KDE 4 sounds, nothing out of the ordinary or impossible to get. That's why I didn't included them in here.

# Are those files safe to use?
I removed every metadata from them that I could find, and extracted the files after using [Tools for Red Star OS](https://github.com/takeshixx/redstar-tools).
Feel free to check them for yourself, if you want to be extra safe, use a VM.

# What's the license for this?
Well there isn't one (for now). All of these files are not mine, I just extracted them from obsure OS. Therefore, I decided to (for now) leave this repository without any License.
